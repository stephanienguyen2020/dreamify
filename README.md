## Inspiration

Reflecting at the end of each year on past actions, objectives, and goals sets the stage for future success. However, staying on track without a clear picture of your goals can be challenging. That's why we created Dreamify, a platform that turns your textual goals into a dynamic, personalized vision board.

## What it does

Dreamify is an innovative platform that effortlessly transforms your goals and aspirations into a visually appealing vision board. Here are some key features:

- **AI-Generated Variations:** The AI creates four different versions of your vision board, allowing you to choose the one you like the most. It then fine-tunes the selected version, making your favorite images more prominent.

- **Categorized Goals:** Organize your dreams with categories like Education, Finance, and Health.

- **Personal Dashboard:** Beyond visualization, Dreamify suggests actionable steps and tracks your monthly progress. Maintain daily streaks by checking in, and receive push notifications to stay on track.

- **Reference Boards:** If you're new to vision boards, we've got inspiration boards to get your creative juices flowing.

## How we built it

The design process began with Figma, where we meticulously crafted mockups for an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. We chose React for the frontend, leveraging its robust capabilities, and used Tailwind CSS for styling efficiency.

For the backend, ExpressJs was utilized for a scalable web application, with MongoDB hosting the database. OpenAI API was employed for creating and processing images for the dashboard.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced challenges in hosting, time constraints, frontend-backend integration, and maintaining design consistency across different pages. Testing and debugging were complicated due to the segmented hosting environment.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully launching a fully functional landing page and personal dashboard.

## What we learned

Collaboration, effective communication, task division, and feature prioritization were crucial aspects. Balancing frontend design with backend development and machine learning taught us to create a robust and intelligent product.
